"""
This file has been moved to `scripts/send_arduino_command.py` to make the
repository layout clearer. The original top-level file is kept as a small
shim to avoid breaking existing workflows.

Please run the new script:

  python scripts/send_arduino_command.py --help

You can safely delete this shim if you prefer a clean top-level layout.
