This file moved to `scripts/play_and_eject.py` to make the repository layout
clearer for sharing. Run the script in `scripts/` instead.

You can run:

  python scripts/play_and_eject.py --help

If you used a batch file that referenced the old path, update it to the new
location or keep this shim for compatibility.
